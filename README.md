<h1>Avatar Community</h1>

<h2>About the Site:</h2>Welcome to the Avatar Community! This a collaborative site for all Avatar the Last Airbender fans to enjoy. This site is meant to serve as a space for ATLA fans to add, edit, and enjoy info on the characters of ATLA. All characters are divided into their respective nations and have a fun fact as well as basic info. As previously mentioned, this is meant to be a collaborative space for all to enjoy. If there's a character missing from the page, users have the freedom to update the page so that the information is correct! Fans can also add characters that may be missing, and have the power to delete characters that have been placed in the wrong nation or are just fictional creations added.

<h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>
In the future I would like to implement a funtional search bar that allows the user to search any Rick and Morty character by name, and returns an image and details about them. I would also like to create an array of gifs that changes the applications background depending on the array index of the character the user searches.
